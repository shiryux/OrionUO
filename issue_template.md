# Information we need from you if you want to have something fixed:

* Add a link to the server you're playing on.
* If this is your local server: provide a link to emulator you're using and provide a link to client files you're using.
* If this is a closed private shard: provide us with info in a personal message to Aimed

* Describe the bug and add a screenshot ( or a gif/mp4 ) from EA's classic 2d client and from Orion client.
http://https://gyazo.com is a very nice tool for this.

* After you've done how to repeat actions and triggered the bug, close the client and look for uolog.txt in a folder where you have OrionUO.exe and upload it in your thread.
* If your uolog.txt is too big, you probably had a long client session. Just restart Orion client and do how to steps again, close the client and upload a smaller version of your uolog.txt.
